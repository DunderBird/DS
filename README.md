# DS: Data Structure

This is my practice of my Data structure lesson, I will try to make it like a mini stl (: although I have little experience building a large project.

Due to my limited ability, there may be many bugs in this project. Feel free to point them out and I'll appreciate it if you can give some advice.

Flag: I will finish this project before this semester ends!!! (haha)
